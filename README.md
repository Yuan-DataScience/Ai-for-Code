# AI for Code: Leveraging Machine Learning Techniques to Profile Source Codes

## Project Description
This project, titled **"AI for Code: Leveraging Machine Learning Techniques to Profile Source Codes"**, aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development by applying artificial intelligence techniques to analyze, understand, and manipulate code.

**AI for code** involves:
- Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the structure and meaning of code.
- Utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict the behavior of code.
- Employing AI-powered tools to assist with debugging, testing, and optimization.

The primary objective is to analyze a large-scale dataset of 14 million code samples from IBM called CodeNet, focusing on one programming language (e.g., C++, Python). The analysis will classify the code samples based on their resource requirements, such as memory usage and CPU utilization. This approach will help identify resource-hungry code patterns, suitable coding techniques for resource-limited devices (e.g., embedded systems), and better predict the requirements for running a program.

## Technologies Used
